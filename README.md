## Introduction

This is my personal and customized coding environment, originally forked from [Pear](https://github.com/201-created/pear) made by [201 Created](http://www.201-created.com/).

## Installation

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TSiege/tristan/master/installer.sh -L -o - | sh
```

### Notes

You can create a `~/.gitconfig.local` for any local git config overrides. It
is automatically included.
